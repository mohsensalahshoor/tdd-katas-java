# tdd-katas-java
Implementation of TDD katas at the [behaviour driven blog](https://www.michael-whelan.net/code-katas-for-practicing-tdd/) in Java.

## Kata #1  
Write a program to generate all the permutations of an input string.  
(Although the first Kata at the [behaviour driven blog](https://www.michael-whelan.net/code-katas-for-practicing-tdd/) is about finding all the anagrams, I decided to modify the kata a little bit and turn it into "Finding all the permutations". The reason I did this is because anagrams are meaningful words that are rearramgements of the characters of a particular word, but permutations are actually not necessarily meaningful rearrangements of n different objects.
So I used "Finding all the permutations of a given string" as the problem statement, since this is more correct for the solution given in the [behaviour driven blog](https://www.michael-whelan.net/code-katas-for-practicing-tdd/) for the kata.)
